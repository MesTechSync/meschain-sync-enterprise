## 🛡️ RISK MITIGATION STRATEGY

### ⚠️ Identified Risks & Mitigation

#### 🔴 High Risk: System Downtime
- **Mitigation:** Blue-green deployment with instant rollback
- **Backup Plan:** Automated failover to previous version
- **Response Time:** <30 seconds rollback capability

#### 🟡 Medium Risk: Performance Degradation
- **Mitigation:** Pre-tested load balancing and auto-scaling
- **Backup Plan:** Manual resource scaling procedures
- **Response Time:** <5 minutes performance restoration

#### 🟢 Low Risk: Configuration Issues
- **Mitigation:** Infrastructure as Code (IaC) validation
- **Backup Plan:** Automated configuration rollback
- **Response Time:** <2 minutes configuration fix

### 🔄 Rollback Procedures
```
Emergency Rollback (if needed):
1. Traffic routing back to blue environment (30 seconds)
2. Database rollback to last known good state (2 minutes)
3. Service verification and health checks (1 minute)
4. Incident analysis and post-mortem (24 hours)
```
