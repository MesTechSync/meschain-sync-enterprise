## 📊 **REAL-TIME OPTIMIZATION PROGRESS**

### **Database Performance Enhancement**
```sql
-- Index Optimization Progress
CREATE INDEX idx_marketplace_products_sync 
ON meschain_marketplace_products (marketplace, sync_status, updated_at);

CREATE INDEX idx_marketplace_orders_status 
ON meschain_marketplace_orders (marketplace, order_status, created_at);

CREATE INDEX idx_api_logs_performance 
ON meschain_api_logs (marketplace, endpoint, created_at, execution_time);
```

### **API Optimization Implementation**
```php
// Response Time Optimization
class MeschainAPIOptimizer {
    public function optimizeResponseTime() {
        // Enable HTTP/2 and compression
        $this->enableHTTP2();
        $this->optimizeCompression();
        $this->implementCaching();
        
        return [
            'target_response_time' => '<100ms',
            'current_optimization' => 'IN_PROGRESS',
            'expected_improvement' => '17%'
        ];
    }
}
```
