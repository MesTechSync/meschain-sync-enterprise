## 🔧 PHASE 2 EXECUTION FRAMEWORK

### Database Backup Validation (01:00-01:15)
```bash
# PHP Backup System Test Sequence
1. Execute backup_system.php with test parameters
2. Validate database backup file generation
3. Test backup file integrity and compression
4. Verify log file creation and error handling
5. Simulate restore operation (dry-run)
```

### File System Backup Testing (01:15-01:30)
```javascript
// JavaScript Backup Manager Test Sequence
1. Initialize BackupManagement class v8.0
2. Test file system traversal and exclusions
3. Validate backup completeness and checksums
4. Test multi-cloud upload simulation
5. Verify real-time analytics collection
```

### Configuration Backup Verification (01:30-01:45)
```powershell
# PowerShell Script Test Sequence
1. Execute backup_system.ps1 cross-platform test
2. Validate configuration file backup
3. Test encrypted backup system functionality
4. Verify Windows batch compatibility
5. Check backup dashboard accessibility
```

### Recovery Procedure Validation (01:45-02:00)
```bash
# Disaster Recovery Simulation
1. Simulate various failure scenarios
2. Test backup file restoration procedures
3. Validate recovery time objectives (RTO <15 min)
4. Test recovery point objectives (RPO <5 min)
5. Document recovery procedures and times
```
