## 4. Connectivity Guide & Recommendations

- **API Controller** is the central hub, connecting UI, models, helpers, and webhooks.
- **JS Integration** communicates with the API Controller for real-time sync and analytics.
- **TWIG Templates** are rendered by the Admin Model for both admin and user panels.
- **Deployment Scripts** ensure all components are correctly deployed and validated.
- **Testing Dashboard** provides live feedback on deployment and integration status.
- **Language Files** should be completed for full localization support.

---

## 5. Action Items for Production Excellence

- [ ] Complete and review all language files for full coverage.
- [ ] Increase test coverage for models, controllers, and helpers.
- [ ] Enhance error handling and logging in all backend scripts.
- [ ] Automate more deployment steps in shell/PHP scripts.
- [ ] Document all new or updated modules/components.
